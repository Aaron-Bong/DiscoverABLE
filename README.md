# DiscoverABLE
DiscoverABLE by QuadHACK, GovHACK 2016, Christchurch

DiscoverABLE helps to restore and rebuild independence, strengthen both individual resilience and diversity within our community giving everyone a sense of purpose, belonging, fun, freedom and spontaneity. We do this by providing an Aurally Augmented reality experience for the visually impaired. We used the Meteor framework for fast development and a CCC provided dataset of toilet locations.
